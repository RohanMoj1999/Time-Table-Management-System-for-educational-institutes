# Time-Table-Management-System-for-educational-institutes
#Front-End: Python, Back-End: Ms SQL
In this project, I've designed a scheduling system with the help of Python and Ms SQL.
With python, I've created a GUI from where user can enter data and the data will be stored in Ms SQL.
Features include:
1. Inserting data through python based GUI data-fields
2. storing the data in Ms SQL database table
3. modify or delete data from that table
4. share the database table to the recipients if required via python email system.

### To design the GUI
To design the GUI window, we need certain libraries:
1. ```tkinter```: to design the GUI window
2. ```pillow```: to set background image for the GUI window
